## Mini Courses

### [R for Successful Student Projects (R4SSP)](r4ssp) 

R for successful student projects was a mini-course in a flipped-classroom format where the material is available and run through in your own time and drop in sessions for questions/assistance are run. For more information about the content and sessions see [THIS PAGE](r4ssp). 

In 2024, R4SSP is being re-designed and the content of R4SSP will be covered through:

- **Introduction to Data Analysis and Visualisation with R** will be covered by Data Carpentry workshops
- The extra content in R4SSP on data analysis and visualisation will be delivered by a separate workshop.
- **R Programming** will be covered by a stand-alone separate workshop
