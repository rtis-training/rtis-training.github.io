# R for Successful Student Projects

## Course description

Advances in scientific technologies from remote sensors to genetic sequencers mean scientists are now working with huge data sets, and must be expert in the computer tools that can analyse those data. Many undergraduate science papers now require students to process and analyse real data using special programming languages like R. In this mini-course, we will help you to learn exactly those parts of R that science students need for their in-course research assignments. Class sessions combine structured presentation of new material, and hands-on coding practice with support from experienced R programmers, scientists, and educators.

There is no assessment or credit offered as part of this course.

### Feedback

It would be greatly appreciated if as you complete modules you fill in this three question survey [https://tinyurl.com/r4ssp-module-fb](https://tinyurl.com/r4ssp-module-fb) which will help further iterations of the course.

### Sessions and Help

**What:** These sessions will be structured as a workshop with content taught and some exercises available. There will also be an opportunity to get assistance with code you are working on. To get the most out of these sessions bringing your own device with access to R/RStudio is strongly recommended.

**When:** Semester 1 - Wednesdays 10 and 12 noon, starting from 16th March.

**Where:** On Zoom - please sign up to be emailed a zoom invite

It is possible to complete the course in your own time, but the drop-in sessions will follow this schedule.

Date | Module | Part | Topic 
---|---|---|---
16 March | Setup | | Introduce the tools: R and RStudio
 23 March | Data Focus | 1 | Looking at Data
 30 March | Data Focus | 2 | Selecting and Filtering Data
 6 April| Data Focus | 3 | Transforming Data
 13 April | Data Focus | 4 | Summarising Data

During the sessions assistance for your own code projects can also be saught.



### Other ITS operated R courses

University of Otago ITS also offer free courses for students and staff for R. Descriptions and registration can be found at [https://corpapp.otago.ac.nz/training/its/course/subject/research-tools/](https://corpapp.otago.ac.nz/training/its/course/subject/research-tools/)

### Other places to learn more about R or get help

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) is a global organisation that provides workshops to teach computational skills for researchers. Periodically we run these workshops on campus. Check out [https://otagocarpentries.github.io/](https://otagocarpentries.github.io) for up-coming workshops run at Otago. The workshop content is also free and available to be worked through outside of the workshops. These are the R relevant workshops from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org):

- [Data Carpentry - Ecology](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/)
- [Data Carpentry - Social Sciences](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/)
- [Software Carpentry - Programming with R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation)
- [Software Carpentry - R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder)

[R for Data Science online community](https://www.rfordatasci.com) is an online community created to help people learn R from the [R for Data Science book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) by Hadley Wickham.
