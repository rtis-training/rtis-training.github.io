# R for Successful Student Projects

## Course description

Advances in scientific technologies from remote sensors to genetic sequencers mean scientists are now working with huge data sets, and must be expert in the computer tools that can analyse those data. Many undergraduate science papers now require students to process and analyse real data using special programming languages like R. In this mini-course, we will help you to learn exactly those parts of R that science students need for their in-course research assignments. Class sessions combine structured presentation of new material, and hands-on coding practice with support from experienced R programmers, scientists, and educators.

There is no assessment or credit offered as part of this course.

- Staff are welcome to participate in the course

### Feedback

It would be greatly appreciated if as you complete modules you fill in this three question survey [https://tinyurl.com/r4ssp-module-fb](https://tinyurl.com/r4ssp-module-fb) which will help further iterations of the course.

### Sessions and Help

**What:** These sessions will be structured as a workshop with content taught and some exercises available. There will also be an opportunity to get assistance with code you are working on. To get the most out of these sessions bringing your own device with access to R/RStudio is strongly recommended.

**When and where:** Semester 1 2023 R for Successful Student Projects (R4SSP) will be online via Zoom, 10am-noon Tuesdays. An in-person help/study group session will run 3:30-4:30pm on Thursdays.

### Other ITS operated R courses

University of Otago ITS also offer free courses for students and staff for R. Descriptions and registration can be found at [https://corpapp.otago.ac.nz/training/its/course/subject/research-tools/](https://corpapp.otago.ac.nz/training/its/course/subject/research-tools/)

### Other places to learn more about R or get help

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) is a global organisation that provides workshops to teach computational skills for researchers. Periodically we run these workshops on campus. Check out [https://otagocarpentries.github.io/](https://otagocarpentries.github.io) for up-coming workshops run at Otago. The workshop content is also free and available to be worked through outside of the workshops. These are the R relevant workshops from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org):
